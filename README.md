# Cricket-Players-Injury-Risk-Prediction

This project is a cricket player injury risk prediction system that uses machine learning to assess the likelihood of injuries based on player attributes such as age, match load, training intensity, fatigue level, BMI, and other environmental and lifestyle factors. By employing a Random Forest Classifier, it categorizes the injury risk into three levels: Low, Medium, and High. The system not only predicts the risk but also provides recommendations for injury management based on the predicted level, including preventive measures and recovery strategies. The project features an interactive user interface built with Streamlit, allowing coaches, trainers, and players to input personal data and receive instant feedback on injury risk, making it a useful tool for injury prevention and player management in cricket.
